    "From a young age I've always had a passion for photography, and enjoy taking pictures of just about anything and everything! At A-Level I decided to take this passion further by studying Photography. I was able to develop all kinds of different skills, from in camera and post-production image manipulation, to developing film and prints in the darkroom. I really enjoyed this subject and managed to achieve an A* in the course.",
